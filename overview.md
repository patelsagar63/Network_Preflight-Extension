# Network Preflight (HTTP/DNS/TCP)
Validate **HTTP**, **DNS**, and **TCP** connectivity from your build/release agents **before critical deployments**. Catch network issues early, fail fast, and ship with confidence.

---

## ✅ Why use Network Preflight?
- Detect **firewall or DNS issues** before production releases.
- Validate **critical endpoints** (APIs, databases, identity providers) from the actual agent environment.
- Reduce deployment failures caused by **network misconfigurations**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **HTTP(S) Check**  
  Validate URLs for reachability, status codes, latency, and optional headers.
- **DNS Lookup**  
  Resolve A/AAAA/CNAME records with optional expected target validation.
- **TCP Probe**  
  Test raw TCP connectivity to `host:port` with configurable retries and timeouts.
