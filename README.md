## Network Preflight

An **Azure DevOps Pipelines extension** that validates network connectivity **from the build/release agent** before critical deployments. This helps you catch DNS, HTTP, or TCP connectivity issues early in your pipeline.

## ✅ Why use Network Preflight?
- Detect **firewall or DNS issues** before production releases.
- Validate **critical endpoints** (APIs, databases, identity providers) from the actual agent environment.
- Reduce deployment failures caused by **network misconfigurations**.

## 🚀 Features
- **HTTP(S) Check**  
  Validate URLs for reachability, status codes, latency, and optional header checks.
- **DNS Lookup**  
  Resolve A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT/NS records with optional custom DNS resolver.
- **TCP Probe**  
  Test raw TCP connectivity to `host:port` with optional TLS and SNI support.

## 📦 Tasks Overview
| Task Name      | Purpose                                  | Key Inputs                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `HttpCheck@1`  | Validate HTTP(S) endpoints              | `targets`, `method`, `expectStatus`        |
| `DnsLookup@1`  | Resolve DNS records                     | `targets`, `recordType`, `resolver`        |
| `TcpProbe@1`   | Test TCP connectivity (TLS optional)    | `targets`, `useTls`, `serverName`     

All tasks run on Node 20 (current Azure Pipelines guidance).

## 🛠 Inputs (Common)
- **targets**: Multi-line list of endpoints (URLs or host:port).
- **timeoutSeconds**: Timeout per check (default: 10).
- **failOn** (future enhancement): Control failure behavio
